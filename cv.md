# Personal information

Briefly about myself:
In the 2000s, since the purchase of the first computer, I became interested in computer technology.

Working in a state organization, as far as possible, he independently studied the PC and the principles of work.

For some time he worked in the information department, filling in databases, as well as working with various reporting documentation. At the same time, he began developing summary reports in MS Excel to automate the workflow, and developing simple databases using SQLite and Pascal.
In the future, continuing the process of self-learning, he moved to the position of lead engineer, servicing all the electronics of the organization, both at the physical and software levels.

At the same time, I realized that most of all I would like to create software and entered the University in this direction and at the moment I am actively studying programming languages.
